# BORG: A Modular AI Development Environment for Higher Education

**Built by Magn√∫s Sm√°ri Sm√°rason and team at the University of Akureyri**
**Status: Beta v1.1 ‚Äì Independent system with legacy auth SSO integration**
**For: Diverse university userbase ‚Äì faculty, staff, and research groups**

## üîç Overview

BORG is a full-stack, GPU-accelerated digital environment designed to provide secure, multilingual, and AI-integrated functionality for universities. It was developed in-house over six months by a compact, focused team. The system is designed for extensibility, local AI deployment, and optimal user experience across roles ‚Äì from educators and administrators to researchers and support staff.

The system operates independently from legacy software stacks, relying solely on centralized Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication to maximize user continuity while retaining full backend autonomy and innovation capacity.

## üöÄ Development Methodology

Due to the innovative nature of this project and its scope within higher education AI integration, the development approach diverged from traditional DevOps terminology and practices. The methodology centered around:

### Problem-First Approach

* **Broad Problem Statement:** Addressing AI accessibility and integration challenges in Icelandic higher education
* **Use Case Discovery:** Iterative identification of real-world faculty, staff, and research needs
* **User-Centered Design:** Direct feedback loops with diverse university stakeholders

### Experimental Development Cycle

* **Rapid Prototyping:** Quick iteration cycles to test AI integration concepts
* **Continuous Experimentation:** Testing different AI models, interfaces, and workflows
* **Progressive Polishing:** Incremental refinement based on user feedback and technical learnings

### Current State: Beta & Beyond

Now entering beta phase, the system has evolved to embrace:

* **CI/CD Implementation:** Structured deployment pipelines for production stability
* **DevOps Best Practices:** Infrastructure as code, monitoring, and automated testing
* **LLM-Assisted Architecture:** Full system designed to leverage AI-assisted coding workflows
* **Best Practices Focus:** Code quality, security, and maintainability standards

This approach allowed for genuine innovation while building toward enterprise-grade reliability and maintainability.

## üíª System Architecture

### üßä "Borg Cubes" Design Philosophy

The system is architected around modular "Borg cubes" - interchangeable AI tool components designed for rapid evolution and institutional resilience:

* **Interchangeable Components:** Due to the rapid pace of AI progress, all AI tools are designed as modular, swappable units
* **Zero Critical Dependencies:** No institutional-sensitive dependencies ensure the system remains operational even if external services go offline
* **Future-Proof Architecture:** Components can be easily replaced, upgraded, or reconfigured without affecting the core system
* **Institutional Independence:** Critical university functions continue operating regardless of external AI service availability
* **Workflow Integration Focus:** Tools are designed to integrate seamlessly into users' existing workflows rather than providing "ready-made solutions"
