### **Project: Strategic Policy for AI Governance in Higher Education**



#### **Overview**

I led the design and implementation of the University of Akureyri's institutional strategy for artificial intelligence. The result is a comprehensive **guiding policy** that establishes a framework for the responsible, ethical, and legally compliant adoption of AI across all academic and administrative functions.

The policy is built on a progressive **"permitted by default"** principle to encourage innovation. However, it is architected as a "living document," designed to evolve and ultimately make itself obsolete as responsible AI use becomes standard practice.

#### **The Strategic Challenge**

In a high-stakes environment defined by the rapid evolution of AI and the introduction of the EU AI Act, the university required a robust strategy. The challenge was to create a framework that could future-proof the institution by balancing cutting-edge innovation with the non-negotiable principles of academic integrity, data protection, and ethical responsibility.

#### **My Leadership & Contribution**

As the university's **AI Project Manager**, I was responsible for architecting and executing the strategy. My role involved:

* **Directing the research and analysis** of international best practices, ensuring the final policy was aligned with the EU AI Act and UNESCO guidelines.
* **Authoring the core policy** and its technical appendices, translating complex legal and ethical requirements into clear, actionable guidelines.
* **Designing and leading a multi-stage consultation process** with university stakeholders to build consensus and ensure the policy's practical effectiveness.
* **Developing a formal risk-assessment framework** for vetting new AI technologies, establishing a clear process for safe and secure adoption.

#### **Strategic Highlights of the Policy**

* **Balances Innovation and Trust:** Implements a "permitted by default" stance to empower users, framed by rigorous requirements for transparency and human accountability.
* **Evidence-Based & Legally Sound:** Aligns fully with the EU AI Act and GDPR, and makes a clear, research-backed decision to prohibit the use of unreliable AI-detection tools for assessments.
* **Establishes Clear Standards:** Provides a definitive framework for what constitutes "significant human contribution," creating a defensible standard for academic work.
* **Focus on Long-Term Viability:** The policy is designed as a temporary, evolving framework with the explicit goal of building institutional capacity until a separate policy is no longer required.


**Status:** The policy is currently undergoing a final, multi-stakeholder review by a third-party expert, university faculty, staff, and student representatives. It is scheduled for submission to the University Council for formal adoption in **August 2025**.
